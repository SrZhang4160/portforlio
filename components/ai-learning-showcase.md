Generate a patient-friendly explanation for the following glaucoma 
monitoring results:

Patient: {patient_name}
IOP Reading: {pressure_value} mmHg
Trend: {trend_direction}
Medication: {current_medication}
Risk Factors: {risk_factors}

Requirements:
1. Use simple, non-technical language
2. Explain what the numbers mean
3. Provide clear next steps
4. Include reassurance where appropriate
5. Maintain medical accuracy
`;

// AI-generated patient report example
const patientReport = `
Hi Maria,

Your eye pressure reading today was 16 mmHg, which is within the 
healthy range for you. This is good news! 

Your pressure has been stable over the past month, showing that 
your current medication is working well. Keep taking your eye 
drops as prescribed.

Next steps:
‚Ä¢ Continue daily monitoring with your at-home device
‚Ä¢ Take your evening eye drops as scheduled
‚Ä¢ Your next virtual check-in is in 2 weeks

If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to message your care team.

Stay healthy,
Your Glaucoma Care Team
`;
