## Problem & Clinical Context

### The Healthcare Challenge

**Glaucoma Crisis**: Second leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 80+ million people globally. Early detection and consistent monitoring critical for preventing irreversible vision loss.

**Current Barriers**:
- **Cost**: $150-300 per clinical tonometry appointment
- **Access**: Requires specialized ophthalmology equipment and trained technicians
- **Frequency**: Patients need regular pressure monitoring but often skip appointments due to inconvenience
- **Early Detection**: Many patients undiagnosed until significant vision loss occurs

### Patient Impact Story

*"Maria, a 55-year-old teacher, was diagnosed with early-stage glaucoma but struggled with quarterly $200 monitoring appointments. Between work schedules and costs, she missed 40% of recommended check-ups. Our solution enables daily pressure tracking at home for the cost of two clinical visits."*

**Clinical Significance**: Consistent pressure monitoring can prevent 90% of glaucoma-related vision loss when caught early.
